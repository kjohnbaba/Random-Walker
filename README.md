# Random-Walker

* Java program  that takes an integer "n" as a command-line argument 
and simulates the motion of a random walk for n steps. Print the
location at each step (including the starting point), treating the
starting point as the origin (0, 0). Also prints the square of the
final Euclidean distance from the origin.
